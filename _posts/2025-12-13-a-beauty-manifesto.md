> The birth of Beauty is a declaration of a war.

Beauty is an ideal, a Form in the Platonic sense—the highest value.
Even good and evil are expressions of beauty and ugliness. Whatever is beautiful is therefore good, both in concrete and abstract terms. Beauty has the power to transform anything into something noble, even death. Death is normally regarded as undesirable, but when it is enveloped in beauty, it can be transformed into the highest good—such as a heroic death: dying for an ideology, dying for an ideal, dying for those you love.

Beauty can transcend your spirit and the spirits of others.
Beauty elevates the soul of both the one who beholds it and the one who embodies it, bringing spiritual richness from the individual level to the level of culture. In some cases, beauty can shatter boundaries—destroy reason, consciousness, and identity—carrying you into an irrational realm that connects the spirit to what cannot be understood. This process is called falling in love.

Beauty always creates hierarchy. Beauty is anti-egalitarian.
You cannot encounter beauty in a world without hierarchy. Beauty requires exclusivity: the drawing of boundaries, the exclusion of ugliness, in order to create beauty. Beauty is an ideal, and an ideal is always pure. Purity implies radicalism; therefore, beauty is always radical—it allows no compromise. A society that demands inclusivity cannot encounter beauty. Any society that calls for the destruction of hierarchy will encounter degeneration: culture will be destroyed, ethics will vanish, and collapse will inevitably follow, because beauty has been erased from society.

*Beauty always wins. All we need is Beauty.*
